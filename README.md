# Graphplan
Implementation of the 'Graphplan' algorithm and design heuristics driven form the planning graph. 


# Introduction
In this project you will implement parts of the Graphplan algorithm and design heuristics driven form the planning graph. In the first part you complete the implementation of the Graphplan and test the algorithms on problems from the "dock-worker robot" domain. In the second part you will use a relaxed version of the planning graph to derive heuristics for A*. In the last part you will automatically create domain and problem files for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore.
  

#  Files you'll edit:

**graphPlan.py**  
Where the graphPlan algorithm runs, this module in charge of creating the Graphplan, extending it if needed and extracting a plan.

**planGraphLevel.py**  
Representation of one level (actions layer and propositions layer) of the graph

**planningProblem.py**  
Representation of planning problem as a search problem

**hanoi.py**  
Where the domain and problem files are created  

# Files you might want to look at:

**action.py**   
The action object. 

**proposition.py**   
The proposition object. 

**actionLayer.py**  
The actionLayer object. 

**propositionLayer.py**   
The propositionLayer object. 

**util.py**  
Useful data structures. 


# What to submit:
You will fill in portions of graphPlan.py, planGraphLevel.py, planningProblem.py and hanoi.py during the assignment.  
 In addition, You will create two instances of the DWR domain, those problem files should be named dwr1.txt and dwr2.txt.
